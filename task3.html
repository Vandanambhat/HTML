    <blockquote style="text-align: justify; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color:cornsilk "><big><mark style="background:darkgoldenrod; ">Dogs (Canis lupus familiaris)</mark></big> are domesticated mammals, not natural wild animals. They were originally bred from wolves. They have been bred by humans for a long time, and were the first animals
        ever to be domesticated. There are different studies that suggest that this happened between 15.000 and 100.000 years before our time. The dingo is also a dog, but many dingos have become wild animals again and live independently of humans in
        the range where they occur (parts of Australia). Today, some dogs are used as pets, others are used to help humans do their work. They are a popular pet because they are usually playful, friendly, loyal and listen to humans. Thirty million dogs
        in the United States are registered as pets.Dogs eat both meat and vegetables, often mixed together and sold in stores as dog food. Dogs often have jobs, including as police dogs, army dogs, assistance dogs, fire dogs, messenger dogs, hunting
        dogs, herding dogs, or rescue dogs.</blockquote>
