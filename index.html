    <h3>ABOUT US</h3>
    <p>Everything we do is for the love of dogs and we are passionate about what we do. With over 80 years of experience making pet food, we're proud of our products. Our dedication goes into every product we make, and we strive to develop great quality,
        nutritious products that'll help keep dogs of all breeds and ages happy and healthy.The dog or domestic dog, (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf which is characterized by an upturning tail. The
        dog derived from an ancient, extinct wolf,and the modern grey wolf is the dog's nearest living relative. The dog was the first species to be domesticated,by hunterâ€“gatherers over 15,000 years ago,before the development of agriculture. Due to their
        long association with humans, dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic individualsand gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.Over the millennia, dogs became uniquely adapted to human
        behavior, and the human-canine bond has been a topic of frequent study.</p>
